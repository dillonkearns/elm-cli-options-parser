module Cli.OptionsParser.BuilderState exposing (AnyOptions, NoBeginningOptions, NoMoreOptions)

{-| A BuilderState is used to ensure that no ambiguous OptionsParsers are built.
For example, if you were to build an OptionsParser that had optional positional
arguments after required positional arguments, it would be ambiguous.

```bash
greet <greeting1> [name1][name2] <greeting2> [farewell]

greet Hi Hello Goodbye
```

Should `"Goodbye"` be set as `[name1]` or `[farewell]`? You could certainly come
up with some rules, but they're not obvious, and you'd have to think really hard!
So we just completely eliminate those confusing corner cases by making it impossible
to express!

The `BuilderState` guarantees that nothing will come after rest args (i.e. `[args]...`,
or 0 or more args that you get as a `List` of values).
And it also guarantees that Optional Positional Arguments will come after everything
but rest args.
